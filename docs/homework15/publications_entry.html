              On January 21, the French National Data Protection Commission
              (CNIL) announced on its website that it had fined Google for
              violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It
              took six months for the EU countries to make a quality level-up in
              the amount of fines for non-compliance with this standard. Prior
              to that, the fine was mainly € 20,000-30,000, with the largest
              fine amounting to € 400,000 and related to a hospital in Portugal.
              But this precedent is interesting not so much the amount of the
              fine as the rigidity of the regulator's approaches. Denis
              Beregovyi, Axon Partners, explains why, especially for Mind.
            </p>
            <p class="textys__p">
              For what? The group complaints against Google arrived at CNIL on
              the same day that the GDPR came into force. The complainants
              reported that Google processed users' personal data without due
              cause, in particular to create personalized advertising offers.

              To the attention of Ukrainian security officers: the inspection
              was conducted online, without searches, without seizure of servers
              or other visible interference for business. And so it was
              possible.
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="subtextys">
            <p class="subtextys__p">
              According to the results of CNIL inspections revealed violations
              of two requirements of the GDPR:
            </p>
            <ul class="subtextys__ul ol-dash">
              <li class="subtextys__ul-li">
                Transparency and awareness of users about the processing of
                personal data.
              </li>
              <li class="subtextys__ul-li">
                Lack of proper user consent for the processing of personal data
                for the purpose of personalizing advertising.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subtextys__pi">
              In the case of personalization of advertising, Google was sure to
              obtain the consent of users, because, firstly, when creating
              Google accounts, the user agrees to the Privacy Policy, and
              secondly, Google has a section "Ads personalization", where you
              can disable this feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="images">
            <div class="images__img">
              <img src="./img/Illustration.jpg" alt="image" />
            </div>
            <p class="images__p">
              This is what the ad personalization settings window in your Google
              Account looks like
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="substext">
            <p class="substext__p">
              However, CNIL does not think so, because the information about the
              personalization of advertising is not clear enough to users. As an
              example, the Commission claims that the relevant "Personalization"
              window does not contain information on the full range of Google
              services that collect and process personal data for this purpose
              (YouTube, Google search, Play Store, Google pictures, Gmail,
              etc.). ), and therefore, the user cannot realize to what extent
              the data is used and how exactly they can be combined.
            </p>
            <p class="substext__p">
              So, let's walk through the text of the CNIL decision
            </p>
            <p class="substext__p">
              Why France and not Ireland. Google operates in Europe through a
              legal entity in Ireland. But the case was not initiated by the
              Irish, but by the French regulator. This is why it happened.
            </p>
            <p class="substext__p">
              If data processing decisions are taken anywhere outside the EU,
              there is a one-stop mechanism - where the complaint is received,
              the body considers it. Because Google's data processing center is
              located in the United States and the complaint was first received
              in France, CNIL considered it.
